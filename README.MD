ðŸŽ¯ In short for the project:
âœ… Using Groq + Llama 3 for testing and basic AI features = great choice (especially if free!).
âœ… We can build 80% of typical features (chatbots, QA, generators) just fine.

Later if we need super advanced capabilities (multi-modal, super complex planning), we could switch to paid GPT-4o or Gemini 1.5.

But for backend pipelines, Fastify servers, basic AI integration â€” Groq is PERFECT right now.

| Category                  | Open-source models (Groq runs)                                  | GPT-4 / GPT-4o / Gemini                                      |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Training data**         | Good but smaller, less secret sauce.                            | Trained on larger and more proprietary data.                 |
| **Reasoning / Logic**     | ðŸ”µ Pretty good, especially with Llama 3-70B.                    | ðŸŸ£ Much better â€” GPT-4 level reasoning is elite.             |
| **Creativity**            | ðŸ”µ Decent, but slightly less nuanced.                           | ðŸŸ£ More creative, subtle, and human-like.                    |
| **Instruction following** | ðŸ”µ Good (especially new Llama 3 models).                        | ðŸŸ£ Outstanding â€” can follow very complex prompts.            |
| **Latency (speed)**       | ðŸŸ£ Groq is crazy fast (faster than OpenAI!).                    | ðŸ”µ GPT is slower because of bigger models, system loads.     |
| **Cost**                  | ðŸŸ¢ Free on Groq now.                                            | ðŸ”´ Pay-as-you-go for GPT/Gemini APIs.                        |
| **Use cases**             | Great for general chatbots, content generation, internal tools. | Best for complex reasoning, serious production apps, agents. |
